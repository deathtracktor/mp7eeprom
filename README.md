## BOSCH MP7.0H EEPROM reset tool

This Aduino-based tool can help to initialize the EEPROM chip of BOSCH MP7.0H ECUs installed on some models of Lada Niva, Lada Samara and Lada 110/111/112 (EURO-3 and EURO-4) with a clean factory dump and thus resurrect the expensive engine controller.

## Pre-requisites

* An Arduino board
* A bricked BOSCH MP7.0 ECU
* 12V power supply or a battery (to power-up the ECU)

## Installation

Compile and upload the binary into your favourite arduino board. Connect to board via a RS-232 terminal. Reset the board, then follow the on-screen instructions.

## BOSCH MP7.0H pinout

You will have to power up your ECU before using the tool. Pinouts can be found in the internet.

## Caution!

No liability. Use it on your own risk.
